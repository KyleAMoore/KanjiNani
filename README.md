    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
    KanjiNani is a Japanese Dictionary app that specializes in searching for words
    and kanji using the pronunciations that they can take. The main purpose is for
    learners to be able to find words that they have heard in passing or in class.

    KanjiNani uses kivy and its companion buildozer as a GUI framework. Information
    on kivy and buildozer can be found at the kivy website: kivy.org.

    All data about the entries in the dictionary (both the kanji and the words)
    was obtained from the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group
    (EDRDG) and can be obtained in its base form from their website: EDRDG.org.
    The specific data used was obtained from the kanjidic2 and the JMdict_e data
    repositories. Information on use of the data provided by the EDRDG can be found

            </li>
            <li>Go to the folder where you downloaded the files to (most likely yout Downloads folder). Select (highlight) the files named <b>KanjiNani_Windows_x64.7z.001</b> and <b>KanjiNani_Windows_x64.7z.002</b> and right click on one of them.</li>
            <li>In the right click menu, click "Extract files...". If you installed 7-Zip instead of WinRAR, this option will be in the side menu labelled <b>7-Zip</b>.</li>
            <li>In the new window, select a location to extract the files into. It is advised that you select an empty folder or create a new folder to extract the files into.</li>
            <li>The program is now installed and can be run by going to the location that you extracted the files to and opening the file named <b>Dokukyou.exe</b>.
                <ul><li>You can create a desktop shortcut for the program by right clicking on the exe file, hovering over <b>Send to</b> and clicking <b>Desktop (create shortcut)</b></li></ul>
