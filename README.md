    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
    KanjiNani is a Japanese Dictionary app that specializes in searching for words
    and kanji using the pronunciations that they can take. The main purpose is for
    learners to be able to find words that they have heard in passing or in class.

    All data about the entries in the dictionary (both the kanji and the words)
    was obtained from the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group
    (EDRDG) and can be obtained in its base form from their website: EDRDG.org.
    The specific data used was obtained from the kanjidic2 and the JMdict_e data
    repositories. Information on use of the data provided by the EDRDG can be found
